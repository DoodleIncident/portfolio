                    <h1>Hi. My name's Charles Lewis.</h1>
                    <span></span>
                    <p>I'm a Computer Science student up at the University of Michigan, back in town for the summer. I was lined up to work at SPAWAR again, but the congressional sequester forced them into a hiring freeze that doesn't show any signs of letting up. That leaves me here, in the middle of June, trying to find a job at this incredibly last-minute time.</p>
                    <span></span>
                    <p>I'd like to believe that I'm a fairly capable coder. I've studied a fair number of languages out of curiosity, and it seems to me that the more of them I learn, the quicker I pick each new one up. Each job I've taken so far has taught me a new language, and I'd love to continue that trend this summer.</p>
                    <span></span>
                    <p>I've gotten the chance to make some pretty cool stuff recently. My work study this last year had me working with an open source javascript library, and they encouraged me to commit my work to a <a href="https://github.com/DoodleIncident/three.js/commit/8f804665faa44af203273225504d78cb73365bcc">fork</a>. I also helped my team win 2nd place at Wolverine Software's 48-hour game design competition. The physics code I wrote didn't get open sourced, but if you have windows, you can play the <a href="http://www.wolverinesoft.org/game/240/the-temple-of-redemption">finished game</a>.</p>
                    <span></span>
                    <p>Feel free to check out my complete resume on the rest of this site. Thank you for taking my application into consideration.</p>
